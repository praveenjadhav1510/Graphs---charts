# Graphs---charts
# React Chart.js Visualization

This project showcases various types of charts (Bar, Line, Area, Scatter, Pie, Column, Bubble, and Pictograph) using **React** and **Chart.js**. The charts use random generated or example data to illustrate how each type can be implemented.

## Features
- Bar chart for visualizing categories like monthly sales.
- Line graph for tracking trends such as website traffic.
- Area chart to show the filled area between two axes.
- Scatter plot for visualizing point data relationships.
- Pie chart for displaying portions of a whole dataset.
- Column chart for vertical bar representations.
- Bubble chart to plot data with varying bubble sizes.
- Pictograph representation using icons (such as apples).

## Technologies
This project is built with:
- **React.js** - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Chart.js** - A JavaScript library for creating charts.
- **React-Chartjs-2** - A React wrapper for Chart.js to make it easier to integrate in React apps.

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/praveenjadhav1510/Graphs---charts
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd Graphs---charts
    ```
3. Install the dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4. Run the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

The app should now be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Available Charts

This app includes the following chart types:

1. **Bar Chart**
2. **Line Graph**
3. **Area Chart**
4. **Scatter Plot**
5. **Pie Chart**
6. **Column Chart**
7. **Bubble Chart**

Each chart is displayed with a unique dataset. Check out the `/src/components/` folder to see the implementations.

## Usage

In the `App.js` file, all the charts are imported and displayed on the main page. You can customize the datasets in each component or add new charts using **Chart.js** by following the documentation links below.

### Example: Line Graph

```jsx
import LineGraphComponent from './LineGraphComponent';

const App = () => {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <h1>React Chart.js Example</h1>
      <LineGraphComponent />
    </div>
  );
};

export default App;
```

### Data Customization
Each chart receives its data through a `data` object. For example, the **Line Graph** uses:

```javascript
const data = {
  labels: ['Week 1', 'Week 2', 'Week 3', 'Week 4'],
  datasets: [
    {
      label: 'Website Traffic',
      data: [500, 600, 700, 800],
      borderColor: 'blue',
      fill: false,
    },
  ],
};
```

You can update this data for your own use cases.
